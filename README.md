# JavaScript Homework Repository

➡️ This repository contains my JavaScript homework assignments for the GoIt course part 8. 

➡️ Each homework assignment is organized in a separate file.

➡️ I added some custom CSS for better UX (hope you like pink! 😅)

I failed with deploy 🥲 will fix that issue later hopefully.
